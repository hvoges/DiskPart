# Powershell Diskpart Module

This little module wraps several diskpart-commands into Powershell-Cmdlets. Most of the Functionality is also available in Powershell, but need additional Functionality like Hyper-V for working with Virtual Hard disks. This modules only dependency is diskpart.exe, which is available in all Windows edtions including Windows PE. 
The main reason I developed this module is to work with VHD-Files in Windows PE.
